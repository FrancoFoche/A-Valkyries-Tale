SetEmote(Empty)
SetBlip(Senko)
???: "On the way, she saw quite a few recently built houses. It seemed like a very new place."
KissShot*: "And as we arrived, i saw the same pink haired oddity waiting for us at the door."
SetBackground(defense, gs4night)
SetEmote(annoyed, Shiro)

Shiro: "Tyook yiou lyong enyough."

KissShot: {abp 3} "Does she have to be here?"

SetEmote(armscrossed, Akira)
SetBlip(Akira)
Akira: "I suppose i should introduce you."
SetEmote(handout, Akira)
Akira: "This is Shiro Kenji. A Nekomata oddity of my own creation."
KissShot: "Of your own... creation?"
Akira: "Shiro. The blades."
Shiro: "..."
Shiro: "Fyne. Bye ryght byack."
???: "And as they waited for Shiro's return, the questions began stacking up inside her mind."
KissShot: "(A human created an oddity... willingly?)"
KissShot: "(Why the hell would he say i am part of true balance, anyway?)"
SetEmote(lollipop, Shiro)
Shiro: "Byack." *Shiro comes back holding two swords, a long black katana, and a short white blade.*
SetEmote(armscrossed, Akira)
Akira: "I assume you know the tales of my blade, Heart Under Blade?"
???: "She recognized the black long katana, yet she did not recognize the short blade."
KissShot: "I wouldn't have searched this much for you otherwise."
Akira: "I see."
Akira: *Akira grabs the black katana* "Heartspan, the sword that can cut through oddities themselves."
SetEmote(bladepose, Akira)
Akira: "The only sword able to truly kill an oddity."
Akira: "And the reason i got such a title to begin with."
Akira: *Akira slashes through a nearby furniture with his blade.* "A blade which if mastered, will only damage an oddity, and not their physical counterpart."
SetEmote(sheathe, Akira)
Akira: *The furniture akira slashed through stands unharmed.* "But if you want to..."
Akira: *Akira slashes through the same furniture again, yet this time, it is cut perfectly in half.* "It can also work as a normal blade."
SetEmote(Annoyed, Shiro)
Shiro: "Yiou dydn't hyave tyo dyestryoy fyurnityure fyor thys exyample."
Akira: "However, this short blade is not as widely known." *Akira gives Shiro his black blade, and takes the short white blade instead.*
Akira: "The counterpart to Heartspan."
Akira: "The Oddity revival blade."
KissShot: "(...revival?)"
Shiro: "(Hyere wye gyo agyain)"
Akira: "A blade which, when used-" *Akira slashes the air in front of him, suddenly creating a monster oddity out of thin air.*
Akira: "Creates an oddity from the energy surrounding it."
Akira: "And the name of this blade is..."
KissShot: "...what the-"
SetEmote(drawn, Akira)
Akira: *Yet before it could fully spawn, in the blink of an eye, Akira grabs Heartspan and slashes through it, cutting it perfectly in half.* "|Dreamspan|."
KissShot: "..."
Shiro: "Why are yiou lyke thys."
Akira: "Shiro is the culmination of my mastery over this blade."
Akira: "Gathering all positive energy from the surrounding town, and carefully manipulating it..."
Akira: "Using my own energy as its catalyst, i was able to create a stable oddity, whose role and personality can acclimate to that of a normal human."
SetEmote(normal, Shiro)
Shiro: "Syup."
SetEmote(Handsmack, Akira)
Akira: "A lot about her current nature is unknown."
Shiro: "Hye jyust myakes mye a hyousekyeeper untyl hye fynds out."
KissShot: "An oddity who has lost its nature and abides by human rules..."
SetEmote(13, KissShot)
KissShot: "How... delightful."
???: "To an oddity, the idea of not fulfilling their role as an oddity is... a foreign concept, to say the least."
SetEmote(3, KissShot)
KissShot: "And why is she... this."
Shiro: "Whyat dyo yiou myean?"
SetEmote(wonder, Akira)
Akira: "I would like clarification as well."
KissShot: *KissShot looks at Shiro's two tails and cat ears.* "...Nevermind."
KissShot: "(Must have been pretty positive energy.)"
SetEmote(Stop, Akira)
Akira: "Now, Heart Under Blade."
Akira: "I have heard your request, and i have denied it."
Akira: "What will you do now?"
KissShot: "I..."
KissShot: "..."
Akira: "Think carefully about your reply. The power of words is nothing to underestimate in this world."
KissShot: "I don't..."
KissShot: "...want to be the queen of vampires anymore."
KissShot: "I don't know if i want to die, but..."
KissShot: "I don't want to live like this anymore."
SetEmote(headdown, Akira)
Akira: "..."
Akira: "And you believe death to be your only way out of this lifestyle?"
???: "She simply nodded."
KissShot*: "I firmly believed there was no other way."
???: "And yet..."
Akira: "And what if i told you there is one other way?"
KissShot: "...?"
???: "Her curiosity was peaked."
SetEmote(annoyed, Shiro)
Shiro: "(Hye's nyot thynkyng whyat y thynk hye's thynking, ys hye?)"
SetEmote(Handup, Akira)
Akira: "Heart Under Blade." *Akira throws Heartspan at KissShot*
SetEmote(7, KissShot)
KissShot: *KissShot grabs the sword out of the air, being careful not to get cut by it.* "...hm?"
Akira: "Slash me."
SetEmote(6, KissShot)
KissShot: "...what?"
Shiro: "(Eyup.)"
Akira: "With everything you've got."
SetEmote(5, KissShot)
KissShot: "So you want |me| to kill |you| now?"
SetEmote(headdown, Akira)
Akira: "I have never implied such a thing. I said..."
SetEmote(disapprovement, Akira)
Akira: "|Slash me.|"
Akira: "|With everything you've got.|"
SetEmote(14, KissShot)
KissShot: "..."
KissShot*: "A weird request, to be sure."
???: "At the time, she didn't understand why The Oditty Killer would ask her to do such a thing."
KissShot*: "But even so, i did have some pent up anger to let go of."
SetEmote(16, KissShot)
KissShot: "Fine by me." *KissShot takes a fighting stance*
Akira: "Do not hold back, and you may get your wish granted."
SetEmote(17, KissShot)

KissShot: "Like |hell| i would!" *In the blink of an eye, KissShot slashes at Akira with all of her might. Her sword goes through Akira's torso perfectly.*
???: "She didn't take The Oddity Killer's request lightly, she really gave it all she had."
KissShot*: "And to my surprise..."
Akira: "..." *Akira stands proudly, with no visible wound on their body.*
UnPauseMusic()
KissShot*: "Akira was unharmed."
SetEmote(3, KissShot)
KissShot: "..."
KissShot: "What... just happened?"
SetEmote(armscrossed, Akira)
Akira: "Heartspan is a sword which bends to the will of its wielder, this is true, however."
Akira: "Its effect depends on the wielder's true intentions."
Akira: "Had you intended to kill me, the sword would have granted that wish."
Akira: "And yet, here i stand, unharmed."
KissShot: "..."
Akira: "Heart Under Blade."
KissShot: "..."
SetEmote(Stop, Akira)
Akira: "I have decided, you shall accomplish your wish."
KissShot: "..."
Akira: "You shall stop your life as the queen of vampires."
Akira: "|And become a goddess.|"
