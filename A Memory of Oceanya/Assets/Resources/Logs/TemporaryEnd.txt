Kam: "I wish i could have made it longer, however, the time i had was limited for this midterm."
Kam: "Also would have made an actual pause menu and main menu, and other things."
Kam: "I had to concentrate on ironing out bugs, and implementing design patterns and stuff."
Kam: "Sadly, most features added weren't in the actual story part of the demo, and were mostly in the intro."
Kam: "However, they are planned to be on the second part."
Kam: "Even so, i hope it was good enough."
Kam: "You can close the application now."
Kam: "Or well, actually, i can do it for you, here."
