???: "A title gained through the power of his blade, and his mastery of it."
KissShot: "The legendary sword, Heartspan, the only blade able to cut through only an oddity."
???: "A non corporeal blade, able to fully damage an oddity beyond repair. While ignoring all physical objects."
KissShot: "Even the gods could be permanently killed with it."
???: "And when she found out such a person existed..."
KissShot: "I laughed."
???: "Such an easy out, hidden away from her all this time."
KissShot: "So, i decided..."
???: "...to find him."
KissShot: "I searched far and wide for him, i headed to a different continent to do so."
???: "Her search lasted many many years."
KissShot: "Oddity Specialists are not easy to find."
???: "They are experts at dealing with oddities, some are bound to try to find them to get rid of them at some point"
KissShot: "Though some specialists are more laid back, and don't mind being easy to find."
???: "This was not the case for the Oddity Killer."
KissShot: "He hid very well."
???: "And after 30 years had passed..."
KissShot: "I realized i may have set my hopes up for nothing."
???: "Feeling desperate, she decided to go back to her land."
KissShot: "I jumped away, deciding it was better to forget the subject."
???: "Her jump would take her a whole continent over."
KissShot: "And i crashed into a field."
???: "While she is usually good enough to calculate where she would land, this time..."
KissShot: "I had no idea where i was."
???: "Too emotional to have cared to think."
KissShot: "And as i stared at the night sky..."
???: "A person came to greet her."
