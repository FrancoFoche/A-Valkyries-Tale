"I've always wanted to be like him, you know?"
"Strong, charismatic... a true talent. The very best any valkyrie could hope for."
"That's why, when i found out that he died in battle... i got mad. Maybe at myself, maybe at the world itself. I was his childhood friend, after all. Could i really sit around and do nothing?"
"Answer is... i could have. And yet, i didn't. To this day, i don't know if that was the best or worst mistake of my life."
"Let's start from the beginning..."
"This is my story."
"|A Valkyrie's Story.|"

"When i was a kid... i was always with him. No matter where he'd ask me to go, i'd join him, and face whatever adventure he had planned for us."
"They weren't exactly... "safe" adventures."
"But it was all in post of our dream. To become the best valkyries there ever were."
"Quite a tall dream, for some random kids that didn't have any training in any field."
"Even so, we moved forward. It was the only thing he knew how to do, anyway."
"One day, he asked me to join him on his greatest adventure yet..."

Kam: "Follow me into the hall of gods."

???: "It was crazy, wasn't it? Two kids heading to see the gods... it was a suicide mission."
"And yet, that didn't stop us."
"If i asked why, he'd simply say..."

Kam: "For style, dumbass! Come on, Kittan! Let's go!"

???: "..."
Kittan: "It must have been a work of the gods."
"I accepted. And that singular "Fine" changed the course of my life."
"As for the rest..."
"Well, i'll let you see for yourself."
