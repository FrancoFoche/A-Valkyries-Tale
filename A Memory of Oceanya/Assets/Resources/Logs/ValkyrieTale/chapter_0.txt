*You find yourself in an empty space once more, there is nothing to see, nor feel, nor hear.*
*Being alone with your thoughts for long enough, you hear a familiar voice.*
*Though "hearing" might not be the best way to describe it...*


"Oh, you're here again."
"Gosh, it's been a bit hasn't it?"
"Not like anyone who was here before can tell anyway..."
"Or well, maybe this time you're someone new."
"But anyways"
"Isn't this place a bit too simple?"

null:*Even though they're talking to you, you can't see nor hear them.*

"This won't do, won't do at all."
"Let me see if i can..."
"Ahha!"
¬"A bit more familiar i suppose, but not enough. Hmmmmm..."¬

???:¬"Let's add that..."¬
¬"And that¬@SetBackground(Witness, Silence);SetEmote(empty, Narrator)@¬..."¬
¬"And me¬@SetEmote(5, GaenIzuko);SetBlip(empty)@¬, obviously... What's left? Oh, right."¬

RestoreBlip()
Gaen Izuko:¬"Doesn't feel right without this sound, haha"¬

¬"Alright, i believe that's as close as i can get! Now, for ambiance!"¬


null:*Gaen @PlaySFX(FingerSnap, 0.5, 1);SetEmote(BlackScreen, Narrator);SetBackground(Witness, Anime);StopMusic()@ snaps her fingers, and your entire surroundings change.*
*You begin to be able to @PlayMusic(OutsideFunk2)@ hear something as well.*

SetBackground(Witness, Anime)
Gaen Izuko:¬"There we go!"¬

SetEmote(irritated, Shiro)
Kam: "Sucks that we can't get blips."
SetEmote(annoyed, Shiro)
"Or well... actually, nevermind. This dialogue where i complain about Twine 2's limitations doesn't apply to this new unity version."
"I'm not even using these files as my avatar anymore. Let me change."

SetEmote(Explaining_Excited, Loremaster)
"Alright, much better!"
SetEmote(CheckNotes)
"As i was saying..."
"This new Unity version is much better as far as features, and well, everything else as well."
"Our sprites are still blurry as hell due to resolution though. Gotta wait for the artists to finish their work for those things."
"I hope they draw me hot as hell."

SetEmote(6, GaenIzuko)
Gaen Izuko: ¬"You didn't even tell them to draw me yet"¬

Kam: "Well, why would i? You're not that important to the story."

SetEmote(4, GaenIzuko)
Gaen Izuko: ¬"How rude! I am very important, i'll have you know."¬

Kam: "We'll be fine without you, i'll just use a black screen when you're on screen."

SetEmote(7, GaenIzuko)
Gaen Izuko: ¬"Still as half assed as my home, i suppose."¬

SetEmote(Backed_Annoyed, Loremaster)
Kam: "Whatever."

SetEmote(8, GaenIzuko)
Gaen Izuko: ¬"Well then, teasing aside, shouldn't we start the story?"¬

SetEmote(Backed, Loremaster)
Kam: "Yeahyeah, you can start whenever."
"You can use Enter, space, and click to move to the next dialogue. There are a few points where you're obligated to wait a second or two, for the sake of effect."
"Oh and by the way, none of the extra features like choices and battles are in this version. This is just a redo of the Twine 2 Version, i'll add all of those extra things later."

Gaen Izuko: ¬"HaiHai."¬

Kam: "..."
"I hope the artists can make this place look nice... Oh well, too late to regret."

SetEmote(12, GaenIzuko)
Gaen Izuko: *Gaen giggles* ¬"Indeed, now shoo. I've got a story to tell! Again!"¬

Kam: "Fine."

SetEmote(BlackScreen, Narrator)
null:*Kam holds his hand up, and @PlaySFX(FingerSnap, 0.5, 1);SetEmote(BlackScreen, Narrator);SetBackground(Witness, Anime);StopMusic()@ snaps his fingers.*
*The last words you could hear were...*

SetEmote(14, GaenIzuko)
Gaen Izuko: ¬"¬|Enjoy the story.|¬"¬
