???: "Her name..."
KissShot: "Was a curse."
???: "She would get hunted, every day."
KissShot: "For five hundred years."
???: "It's not that she had trouble."
KissShot: "They were easy to beat."
???: "None stood a chance. But, it's not that she was physically strained."
KissShot: "I was just..."
???: "Paranoid."
KissShot: "I wouldn't trust anyone."
???: "She'd just kill anyone that approached her."
KissShot: "And most of the time..."
???: "She'd be right to."
KissShot: "It's not like commoners would approach me often."
???: "According to her, most if not all vampires..."
KissShot: "...die willingly."
???: "An inmortal life is not something that many can handle, but..."
KissShot: "The actual problem with this life for most, was..."
???: "...drinking human blood."
KissShot: "Though oddities are born from thoughts. Vampires are a special case."
???: "There was only one vampire created as a full oddity. The rest were created by them."
KissShot: "Us vampires can create other vampires if we so desire, but for that."
???: "They need to not kill their prey."
KissShot: "Even i was human, once."
???: "She has forgotten most of her life as a human by this point."
KissShot: "I have lived more than ten times more as a vampire, after all."
???: "She seemed to have gotten used to her life."
KissShot: "Most vampires suicide in around 100 years of life as a vampire. If they're strong enough mentally, that is."
???: "And she has lived..."
KissShot: "Six times that amount."
???: "I always thought she seemed ready to go to the other side, but..."
KissShot: "I was still afraid of death."
???: "She existed for so long..."
KissShot: "That not existing anymore felt like the scariest thing in the world."
???: "Even so, she kept having these..."
KissShot: "Thoughts."
???: "Like it wasn't worth it."
KissShot: "Like life had no meaning."
???: "Like she should just..."
KissShot: "Die."
???: "Would it not be better that way?"
KissShot: "So many people have died due to me."
???: "So many people would give it all for her to just..."
KissShot: "Disappear."
???: "So, the idea kept getting bigger and bigger."
KissShot: "And at some points, my will to live was low enough to follow through with some of them."
???: "But every time she was at the brink of death."
KissShot: "I'd regret my actions, like i instinctually wanted to live."
???: "Maybe it was determination."
KissShot: "Maybe it was fear."
???: "Either way, she never fully followed through with it."
KissShot: "The only way for a vampire to stay dead for as long as possible"
???: "Is to jump into a sunny place."
KissShot: "While we are inmortal, jumping into the sun would turn us into ash."
???: "It's not the same as a human death."
KissShot: "Because our deaths are temporary."
???: "If you turn a vampire to ash, and leave its ashes in a dark place"
KissShot: "At some point, even without having consciousness, our regeneration will bring us back."
???: "A vampire's regeneration capability goes down a lot the more damage they take."
KissShot: "So for a normal vampire to regenerate from being ash, it'd take at least a thousand years."
???: "That is, if their ashes are in a dark place."
KissShot: "If they're still impacted by the sun every day..."
???: "Their regeneration will be useless."
KissShot: "They will only be reset back to 0, every morning."
???: "That being said..."
KissShot: "I am not a normal vampire."
???: "A Heart Under Blade's regenerative capabilities are beyond that of a normal vampire."
KissShot: "A normal vampire could regenerate an arm in a couple hours, and a head in a few days."
???: "While she could regenerate her entire upper body in the time it took you to blink. And in the case of being turned to ash..."
KissShot: "I'd give myself just 3 days in the dark."
???: "If she wanted to die, she wouldn't just have to suicide."
KissShot: "I'd need to have an oddity expert and their whole lineage to make sure i stay dead."
???: "Never letting her ashes go into the dark for too long."
KissShot: "But what if they failed?"
???: "She is an inmortal being, she would need a pact with a family that lasted an eternity."
KissShot: "They'd need to keep me dead until everyone in the world has forgotten about me."
???: "Then, her powers would decrease, and her regenerative capabilities would do so as well."
KissShot: "Making the task of keeping me dead a lot easier."
???: "Who knows how long that would take?"
KissShot: "With the existence of physical vampires..."
???: "How long would it take for people to forget they exist?"
KissShot: "Too long."
???: "And so."
KissShot: "I decided to start planning."
???: "She couldn't just ask anyone."
KissShot: "Most would try to kill me on sight."
???: "So she decided to investigate."
KissShot: "And tried to find the best Oddity Expert of the era."
???: "|The Oddity Killer.|"
