"But anyway. If you put your mouse around the top of the screen you should see a thing pop up, that's the volume menu, in case this is too loud."

"Too lazy to manage actual volume of sound files, so."
"Oh, also you can speed up scroll speed for the current dialogue if you click while it is scrolling"
"And, you see that little triangle thing that's bottom right? That's the waiting for input symbol, so you know that you actually have to click or whatever."
