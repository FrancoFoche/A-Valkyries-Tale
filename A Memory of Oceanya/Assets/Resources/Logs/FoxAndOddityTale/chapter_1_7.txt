???: "Make the people believe that she was a God."
KissShot*: "And while for most that would be a difficult task..."
???: "Her powers were grand, to say the least."
KissShot*: "I made rain for farmers around by gathering clouds in the sky..."
???: "Cracked the earth open to discover water sources and natural caves..."
KissShot*: "Quite an excessive power show."
???: "But an effective one."
KissShot*: "The legend of the Golden Goddess began to spread soon after."
???: "They would soon begin to construct temples and pray in her honor."
KissShot*: "It was quite amusing,"
???: "Surprisingly, no interaction needed to be had for her story to be born."
KissShot*: "It seems people quickly believe whatever they want as long as it makes the sense within their own world views."
???: "And, within a few years... her new legend became the norm."
KissShot*: "The Golden Goddess had become the local most told tale."
???: "And then, she noticed she didn't have any appetite anymore."
KissShot*: "It entirely stopped, with no other side effects."
???: "As a vampire, she should have an urge to eat long ago."
KissShot*: "Yet i didn't."
???: "The Oddity Killer and Shiro quickly picked up on that."
KissShot*: "Akira and Shiro measured every change in my body, personality and power along the way."
???: "Maybe a little too much, looking back on it."
KissShot*: "But, they adviced not to think about it too much."
???: "One day, Shiro and Akira received notice that a God named Loki had destroyed a small town somewhere in the yggdrasil."
KissShot*: "Worried Balance might have been broken by this God, they left to investigate."
???: "They trusted KissShot by this point, and so, they left her in charge of the town."
KissShot*: "In that time i spent alone, i met some rather interesting folk."
???: "Blue and Red half-oddity swordmasters began trying to challenge her due to her legend."
KissShot*: "Though this time, i felt no murderous intent from them."
???: "So she let them fight her."
KissShot*: "Not like they were a threat, they fought more between themselves than they fought me."
???: "And even when they didn't, her powers were more than enough to defeat both of them tenfold."
KissShot*: "This would go on to become a daily routine for me as i waited."
???: "It would be her way to pass the time."
KissShot*: "However, something weird was beginning to happen around that time."
???: "People around town began disappearing, without leaving any trace."
KissShot*: "At the time i didn't pay it any attention"
???: "In hindsight, she should have."
KissShot*: "Not like i was the kind to care about that type of problem myself."
???: "After some time, the Oddity Killer and Shiro came back from their trip."
KissShot*: "And to my surprise, they weren't alone."
???: "A little kid had come with them."
KissShot*: "But, that kid didn't seem..."
