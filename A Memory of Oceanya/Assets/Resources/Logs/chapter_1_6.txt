???: "Nonetheless, it was a plan that she hadn't even considered as a possibility yet."
KissShot*: "Granted, that is because i didn't know how that would help."
???: "But she was curious, either way. And so, she listened to what Akira had to say."
KissShot*: "What i heard was... interesting, to say the least."

SetEmote(annoyed, Shiro)
Shiro: "Hye dyoes thys a byt. Byear wyth yt."
Akira: "I'll get to my point in a moment."
KissShot: "..."
Akira: "An Oddity's nature, as much as it is unknown, is not rigid."
Akira: "Their nature comes from perception. Appearance, personality, powers..."
Akira: "All come from the ideas of those that believe in them."
Akira: "That of course includes you, and Shiro."
KissShot: "..." *KissShot stares at Shiro*
SetEmote(normal, Shiro)
Shiro: "Nya?"
KissShot: "(What the hell kind of ideas do the people around here have?)"
Akira: "Change the thoughts and perception of those that think about them, and their form will change accordingly."
SetEmote(headdown, Akira)
Akira: "That being said..."
SetEmote(disapprovement, Akira)
Akira: "Your case is slightly different, KissShot."
KissShot: "..."
???: "She understood what the oddity killer meant."
KissShot*: "While the core rule he mentioned does apply to me..."
???: "Her legend had spread far and wide."
KissShot*: "To change the perception of the legend of KissShot Acerola Orion Heart Under Blade..."
???: "It would take much more time and effort than any other oddity."
KissShot*: "It would take generations."
KissShot: "That will not work, then."
SetEmote(headdown, Akira)
Akira: "Maybe so."
Akira: "But you were very lucky, Heart Under Blade."
KissShot: "How so?"
SetEmote(disapprovement, Akira)
Akira: "This very town you've landed in has no knowledge of you. Nor your legend."
KissShot: "..."
SetEmote(armscrossed, Akira)
Akira: "And, to an Oddity, proximity and importance make a big difference."
Akira: "It adjusts the percentage of change in an Oddity accordingly."
Akira: "If we were to convince these people, perhaps we could change your very self."
SetEmote(disapprovement, Akira)
Akira: "And make you a |God|."
KissShot: "..."
KissShot*: "It was nothing short of insane."
???: "Changing an Oddity's very nature intentionally."
KissShot*: "And changing into a God, no less."
???: "Back then, she had a bad feeling about this."
KissShot*: "But, if my other option was to die..."
???: "What other choice did she have?"
KissShot*: "So, i accepted."
???: "And little did she know..."
KissShot*: "I would soon find out that there is something no one could win against."
???: "Nature itself."
KissShot*: "Because some rules..."

???: "...were never meant to be broken."
